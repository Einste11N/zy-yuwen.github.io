I am Zi-Yan Yuwen (宇文子炎) from the [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.itp.cas.cn/), a Ph.D candidate in gravitation theory and cosmology. My research interests include cosmological first-order phase transitions, primordial black holes, gravitational wave physics, and Pulsar Timing Arrays.

**Cosmological first-order phase transitions**

In the early times of the universe, the "vacuum" of the world was different from nowadays. As the temperature decreases with the cosmic expansion, some true vacuum bubbles arise through quantum tunneling and begin taking over the universe, which is called a cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPTs). Such phase transitions may happen at different energy scales in the early time, such as the electro-weak phase transition that provides gauge Bosons with masses, and the QCD phase transition which triggers the quarks to form baryons. Studies on FOPTs could help us find new physics beyond the Standard Model, leading to a better understanding of the basic rules of nature.

**Primordial black holes**

Black holes are one of the most mysterious celestial bodies in our universe. Primordial black holes (PBHs) are "tiny" black holes formed for some cosmological reasons in the early universe. For example, the quantum fluctuations from inflation may provide a large enough over-dense region at the super-horizon scale, which could collapse to a black hole after re-entering the cosmological horizon. PBH is one of the potential candidates of dark matter and can serve as the seeds of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies.

**Gravitational wave backgrounds**

As one of the most powerful and inspiring tools to detect the physical processes in the early universe, gravitational waves (GWs) are more mentioned in frontier research, especially after LIGO detected GW150914. Stochastic GW backgrounds from cosmological sources may carry information from the earlier universe than the last scattering surface of CMB, providing the dynamics of the early universe. In the meanwhile, GWs from astrophysical sources such as mergers of supermassive black hole binaries can test general relativity in extreme conditions and uncover hidden aspects of astrophysical phenomena. The detection and analysis of GW signals not only enhance our understanding of the universe's evolution but also open new avenues for investigating the origin and structure of spacetime itself.

**Pulsar Timing Arrays**

Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) are powerful tools used in astronomy to detect low-frequency gravitational waves by precisely timing the signals from an array of pulsars. By monitoring the arrival times of pulsar signals over long periods, PTAs can detect subtle changes caused by passing gravitational waves, offering a unique way to study astrophysical phenomena such as supermassive black hole mergers and cosmic inflation. The research significance of PTAs lies in their potential to provide insights into the nature of gravitational waves, the properties of massive black holes, and the dynamics of the universe on cosmological scales.

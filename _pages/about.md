My name is Zi-Yan Yuwen (宇文子炎) from the [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.itp.cas.cn/), and now is a Ph.D candidate in gravitation theory and cosmology. My research interest includes cosmological first-order phase transitions, primordial black holes, gravitational waves, and inflation theories.

Research interests
======

1. Cosmological first-order phase transitions

In the early times of the universe, the "vacuum" of the world was different from nowadays.

2. Primordial black holes

Black holes are one of the most mysterious celestial bodies in our universe. Primordial black holes are "tiny" black holes formed for some cosmological reasons. 

3. Gravitational waves

As one of the most powerful and inspiring tools to detect the physicical processes in the early universe, gravitational waves are more and more mentioned these days, especially after GW150914 was detected by LIGO.
